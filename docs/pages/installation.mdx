# Installing Dojo

Dojo's installation process was designed to be idiomatically consistent with its dependencies, Rust and Cairo.
You can get up-and-running in just a few steps, and be building provable games in no time.

:::note
Windows is not natively supported. We recommend [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for Windows development.
:::

## Installing `protobuf`

You will need [Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/) installed in order to run Dojo's Torii indexer.

Installation will use your system's package manager.
You can find instructions [here](https://protobuf.dev/installation/).

> You can test your installation by running `protoc --version` in your terminal.

## Installing Rust with `rustup`

You will need Rust in order to run Dojo's infrastructure tools Katana and Torii.

You can install the Rust toolchain by running the following in your terminal:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

This will install Rust's executables, including the [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) package manager, in the `~/.cargo` directory.

> You can test your installation by running `cargo --version` in your terminal.

For more information about installing Rust, [see the docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

## Installing Cairo with `starkup`

Dojo is written in [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/), StarkWare's language for creating provable programs.
Cairo was inspired by Rust, and its installation is no exception.

You can install the Cairo toolchain by running the following in your terminal:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.starkup.sh | sh
```

This will install Cairo's toolchain, including the [`scarb`](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) package manager and build tool, in the `~/.asdf` directory.
It will also append a `starkup` command alias to your shell profile.

:::note
`asdf` does not automatically add itself to your path.
Consider appending `~/.asdf/shims` to your terminal's `$PATH` variable to simplify development.
:::

> You can test your installation by running `scarb --version` in your terminal.

For more information about installing Cairo, [see the docs](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup).

## Installing Dojo with `dojoup`

Finally, install Dojo. `dojoup` is the preferred way to install Dojo.

::::steps

#### Install `dojoup`

Install the `dojoup` installer by running the following in your terminal:

```sh
curl -L https://install.dojoengine.org | bash
```

This command will install `dojoup` in the `~/.dojo` directory.
It will also append a `source ~/.dojo/env` command to your shell profile.

> You will need to restart your terminal for the `dojoup` command to be available.

#### Run `dojoup install`

In a new terminal window, run `dojoup install` to install Dojo.

```sh
dojoup install
```

This will install `katana`, `torii`, and `sozo` in the `~/.dojo` directory.

> You can test your installation by running `sozo --version` in your terminal.

For more information on advanced usage, such as installing a particular version or building from source, run `dojoup --help`.

## Installing Dojo with `asdf`

You can alternatively use [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) directly to install and manage Dojo.

::::steps

#### Install asdf

Follow the [asdf installation instructions](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) for your platform, if not already installed.

#### Add the asdf-dojo plugin

```sh
asdf plugin add dojo https://github.com/dojoengine/asdf-dojo
```

#### Install the latest or a specific version

```sh
asdf install dojo latest # For the latest version
asdf install dojo 1.0.0  # For a specific version
```

#### Set the version locally or globally

```sh
asdf set dojo latest        # Set in the project dir
asdf set --home dojo latest # Set globally (in the user's home dir)
```

## Installing Cairo for VS Code

Install the [Cairo 1.0](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1) extension for Visual Studio Code for syntax highlighting and more!
