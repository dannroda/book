# Installing Dojo

Dojo's installation process was designed to be idiomatically consistent with its major dependencies, Rust and Cairo.

You can get up-and-running in three commands: `rustup`, `starkup`, and `dojoup`.

:::note
Windows is not natively supported. We recommend [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for Windows development.
:::


## Installing Rust with `rustup`

You will need Rust in order to run Dojo's infrastructure tools Katana and Torii.

You can install the Rust toolchain, including the [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) package manager, by running the following in your terminal:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

> `rustup` will install Rust's executables in the `~/.cargo` directory.

For more information about installing Rust, [see the docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

## Installing Cairo with `starkup`

Dojo is written in [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/), StarkWare's language for writing provable programs.
Cairo was inspired by Rust, and its installation is no exception.

You can install the Cairo toolchain, including the [`scarb`](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) package manager and build tool, by running the following in your terminal:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.starkup.sh | sh
```

> `starkup` uses the [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) version manager under-the-hood, installing Cairo's executables in the `~/.asdf` directory.

For more information about installing Cairo, [see the docs](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup).

## Installing Dojo with `dojoup`

Finally, you can install Dojo (including Katana, Torii, and Sozo) by running the following in your terminal:

```sh
curl -L https://install.dojoengine.org | bash
```

> `dojoup` will install Dojo's executables in the `~/.dojo` directory.

For more information on advanced usage, such as installing a particular version or building from source, run `dojoup --help`.

### Installing Dojo with `asdf`

You can alternatively use [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) directly to install and manage Dojo.

::::steps

#### Install asdf

Follow the [asdf installation instructions](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) for your platform.

#### Add the asdf-dojo plugin

```sh
asdf plugin add dojo https://github.com/dojoengine/asdf-dojo
```

#### Install the latest or a specific version

```sh
asdf install dojo latest # For the latest version
asdf install dojo 1.0.0  # For a specific version
```

#### Set the version locally or globally

```sh
asdf set dojo latest        # Set in the project dir
asdf set --home dojo latest # Set globally (in the user's home dir)
```

## Installing Cairo for VS Code

Install the [Cairo 1.0](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1) extension for Visual Studio Code for syntax highlighting and more!
