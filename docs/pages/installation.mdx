# Installing Dojo

Dojo's installation process was designed to be idiomatically consistent with its dependencies, Rust and Cairo.
You can get up-and-running in just a few steps, and be building provable games in no time.

> **Windows Users**: Windows is not natively supported. We recommend [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for Windows development.

## Quick Start

For existing Cairo developers, the fastest way to get started is with `dojoup`:

```bash
# Install dojoup
curl -L https://install.dojoengine.org | bash

# Restart your terminal, then install Dojo
dojoup install
```

This will install all necessary dependencies and tools. Skip to [Verification](#verification) to test your installation.

## Detailed Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing Dojo, you'll need these foundational tools:

#### 1. Install Rust with `rustup`

Rust is required for Dojo's infrastructure tools (Katana and Torii).

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

This installs Rust's executables, including the [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) package manager, in the `~/.cargo` directory.

**Verify installation:**
```bash
cargo --version
# Should output: cargo 1.87.0 (or similar)
```

For more information, see the [Rust installation guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).

#### 2. Install Cairo with `starkup`

Dojo is written in [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/), StarkWare's language for creating provable programs.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.starkup.sh | sh
```

This installs Cairo's toolchain, including the [`scarb`](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) package manager and build tool, in the `~/.asdf` directory.

> **Note**: `asdf` does not automatically add itself to your path. Consider appending `~/.asdf/shims` to your terminal's `$PATH` variable to simplify development.

**Verify installation:**
```bash
scarb --version
# Should output: scarb 2.11.4 (or similar)
```

For more information, see the [starkup documentation](https://github.com/software-mansion/starkup).

### Installing Dojo

#### Option 1: Using `dojoup` (Recommended)

`dojoup` is the preferred way to install and manage Dojo installations:

::::steps

#### Install `dojoup`

```bash
curl -L https://install.dojoengine.org | bash
```

This command installs `dojoup` in the `~/.dojo` directory and adds it to your shell profile.

> **Important**: You need to restart your terminal for the `dojoup` command to be available.

#### Install Dojo

In a new terminal window, run:

```bash
dojoup install
```

This installs `katana`, `torii`, and `sozo` in the `~/.dojo` directory.

#### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Install a specific version
dojoup install 1.5.0

# Get help
dojoup --help
```

::::

#### Option 2: Using `asdf`

You can alternatively use [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/) for more advanced version management:

::::steps

#### Install asdf

Follow the [asdf installation instructions](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) for your platform, if not already installed.

#### Add the asdf-dojo plugin

```bash
asdf plugin add dojo https://github.com/dojoengine/asdf-dojo
```

#### Install Dojo

```bash
# Install the latest version
asdf install dojo latest

# Install a specific version
asdf install dojo 1.0.0

# List available versions
asdf list all dojo
```

#### Set the version

```bash
# Set version locally (in project directory)
asdf set dojo latest

# Set version globally (in user's home directory)
asdf set --home dojo latest
```

::::

## Verification

After installation, verify that all tools are working correctly:

### Check Dojo Tools

```bash
# Check Sozo (CLI tool)
sozo --version
# Should output: sozo 1.0.0 (or similar)

# Check Katana (sequencer)
katana --version
# Should output: katana 1.0.0 (or similar)

# Check Torii (indexer)
torii --version
# Should output: torii 1.0.0 (or similar)
```

### Test Your Installation

Create a simple test project to verify everything works:

```bash
# Clone the dojo-intro repository
git clone https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo-intro

# Navigate to the contracts
cd dojo-intro/contracts

# Build the project
sozo build

# Test successful if no errors appear
```

## Code Editor Support

### Visual Studio Code

Install the [Cairo 1.0](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1) extension for:
- Syntax highlighting
- Error detection
- Auto-completion
- Code formatting
