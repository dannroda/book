<Dojo />

<p className="text-xl">
    Dojo is a cutting-edge ECS framework for building provable applications in Cairo,
    versatile enough to support everything from simple NFT services to the most complex onchain games.
    <br />
    Dojo lets you skip the hassle of managing intricate contract patterns, writing complex indexers, or setting up detailed query systems â€”
    letting you focus on bringing your ideas to life quickly and efficiently.

## Dojo ECS Framework

Instead of writing raw contracts, Dojo enables a modern [Entity-Component-System](https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq) approach to building interactive applications.
Write like you would a database schema and have it reflected onchain and synced with your client.
