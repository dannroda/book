# Deploy your Cairo smart contract using Katana. Advanced Tutorial

_Before starting recommend following the [`Interact with katana`](/toolchain/katana/interact.md) chapter to gain a basic understanding of katana, starkli and scarb._

## Contract Deployment and Interaction

### Create a Vote project

```bash
scarb new vote
```

Add contract dependencies to scarb.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
starknet = "2.5.4"

[[target.starknet-contract]]
```

Copy the vote contract to lib.cairo

```rust
/// @dev Core Library Imports for the Traits outside the Starknet Contract
use starknet::ContractAddress;

/// @dev Trait defining the functions that can be implemented or called by the Starknet Contract
#[starknet::interface]
trait VoteTrait<T> {
    /// @dev Function that returns the current vote status
    fn get_vote_status(self: @T) -> (u8, u8, u8, u8);
    /// @dev Function that checks if the user at the specified address is allowed to vote
    fn voter_can_vote(self: @T, user_address: ContractAddress) -> bool;
    /// @dev Function that checks if the specified address is registered as a voter
    fn is_voter_registered(self: @T, address: ContractAddress) -> bool;
    /// @dev Function that allows a user to vote
    fn vote(ref self: T, vote: u8);
}

/// @dev Starknet Contract allowing three registered voters to vote on a proposal
#[starknet::contract]

        self._register_voters(voter_1, voter_2, voter_3);

            self._assert_allowed(caller);
            self.can_vote.write(caller, false);

            if (vote == NO) {

            (yes_percentage, no_percentage)
        }
    }
}
```

### Compile contract and Environment variables setup

Compile your contract using scarb

```bash
scarb build
```

Place the following environment variables in a .env file within the `src/` directory.

```bash
export STARKNET_ACCOUNT=katana-0        #A pre-funded account on the local development network.
export STARKNET_RPC=http://0.0.0.0:5050 #To specify the network, targeting the local katana devnet.
```

Then, ensure your project acknowledges the environment variables:

```bash
source .env
```

### Declare contract

Make sure Katana is already running in separate terminal. Otherwise launch katana

```bash
katana --disable-fee
```

To declare your contract, execute:

```bash
starkli declare target/dev/vote_Vote.contract_class.json
```

Upon successful command execution, you'll obtain a contract class hash: This unique hash serves as the identifier for your contract class within Starknet. For example:

```console
Class hash declared: 0x071092406ababbba5573bbff0074b068aaeb48c9a67ec66abe982ab19bc6997b
```

### Deploy contract

```bash
starkli deploy <class_hash_of_the_contract_to_be_deployed> <voter_0_address> <voter_1_address> <voter_2_address>
```

The first hexadecimal input is the class_hash of the contract, and the next three are the vote account addresses. We can define that the first vote account address corresponds to the address of `katana-0`, while the second and third vote account addresses are associated with `katana-1` and `katana-2`, respectively. Check the list of built-in accounts [here](https://github.com/xJonathanLEI/starkli/blob/e9a28f1b6e37bcc9fc53b7b7130e935894856739/src/account.rs#L76).

```bash
starkli deploy 0x071092406ababbba5573bbff0074b068aaeb48c9a67ec66abe982ab19bc6997b 0x6162896d1d7ab204c7ccac6dd5f8e9e7c25ecd5ae4fcb4ad32e57786bb46e03 0x2d71e9c974539bb3ffb4b115e66a23d0f62a641ea66c4016e903454c8753bbc 0x6b86e40118f29ebe393a75469b4d926c7a44c2e2681b6d319520b7c1156d114
```

After running, expect an output similar to:

```console
Deploying class 0x071092406ababbba5573bbff0074b068aaeb48c9a67ec66abe982ab19bc6997b with salt 0x04baae9a396c3ce27a45b201528ec13b366c25960d640a9a32a8736814d9d8c2...
The contract will be deployed at address 0x02c44f2d396fc5f9caa551e8c1d901d943a3b8cc5c433c88a1bf10b1f15fcd15
Contract deployment transaction: 0x071d6b51e52febfaf2e3ed7dbbf1416190f019d80c73b1bf707d375374ab7cc5
Contract deployed:
0x02c44f2d396fc5f9caa551e8c1d901d943a3b8cc5c433c88a1bf10b1f15fcd15
```

### Call contract [only read state]

The first parameter is the contract address, the second parameter is the function to be called, and the third parameter is the function parameter. Let's pass the address of `Katana-0` account

```bash
starkli call 0x02c44f2d396fc5f9caa551e8c1d901d943a3b8cc5c433c88a1bf10b1f15fcd15 voter_can_vote 0x6162896d1d7ab204c7ccac6dd5f8e9e7c25ecd5ae4fcb4ad32e57786bb46e03
```

After running, expect an output similar to:

```console
[
    "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"
]
```

`1` means this user address can vote.

### Invoke contract [can write state]

The first parameter is the contract address, the second parameter is the function to be invoked, and the third parameter is the function parameter. Let's vote `Yes` with `katana-0` user

```bash
starkli invoke 0x02c44f2d396fc5f9caa551e8c1d901d943a3b8cc5c433c88a1bf10b1f15fcd15 vote 1
```

Now let's vote `No` with `katana-1` user

```bash
starkli invoke 0x02c44f2d396fc5f9caa551e8c1d901d943a3b8cc5c433c88a1bf10b1f15fcd15 vote 0 --account katana-1
```

Let's try to vote again with `katana-0` user

```bash
starkli invoke 0x02c44f2d396fc5f9caa551e8c1d901d943a3b8cc5c433c88a1bf10b1f15fcd15 vote 0
```

Since the same user/signer cannot vote repeatedly, `Katana` will report an error.

```console
Transaction execution error: "Error in the called contract (0x06162896d1d7ab204c7ccac6dd5f8e9e7c25ecd5ae4fcb4ad32e57786bb46e03):

```

7. Query transaction

```bash
### starkli transaction <TRANSACTION_HASH>
starkli transaction 0x071d6b51e52febfaf2e3ed7dbbf1416190f019d80c73b1bf707d375374ab7cc5
```

All the above interaction processes can be seen on the katana client. Pay attention to the status changes of katana at each step.
