# Tutorials

Learn Dojo through hands-on tutorials that take you from your first steps to advanced production deployment. Each tutorial is designed to teach specific skills while building real applications.

## Learning Path

Our tutorials are organized by difficulty level to provide a structured learning experience:

### Beginner Tutorials

Perfect for developers new to Dojo or on-chain games. These tutorials assume basic familiarity with programming but no prior experience with Cairo or blockchain development.

**Prerequisites**: Basic programming knowledge, willingness to learn
**Time commitment**: 1-3 hours per tutorial

- **[Getting started with Dojo Starter](./beginner/dojo-starter)** - Set up your development environment and build your first Dojo application
  - *Estimated time: 2 hours*
  - *Skills learned: Environment setup, basic Dojo concepts, project structure*

- **[Building a simple game](./beginner/simple-game)** - Create a basic game with entities, components, and systems
  - *Estimated time: 2.5 hours*
  - *Skills learned: ECS architecture, game logic implementation, testing*

- **[Your first deployment](./beginner/first-deployment)** - Deploy from local development to testnet
  - *Estimated time: 1.5 hours*
  - *Skills learned: Deployment process, network configuration, testing on testnet*

### Intermediate Tutorials

For developers comfortable with Dojo basics who want to build more sophisticated applications.

**Prerequisites**: Completed beginner tutorials or equivalent experience
**Time commitment**: 3-5 hours per tutorial

- **[Multiplayer game development](./intermediate/multiplayer-game)** - Build a real-time multiplayer game with state synchronization
  - *Estimated time: 4 hours*
  - *Skills learned: Multiplayer architecture, state synchronization, conflict resolution*

- **[Advanced ECS patterns](./intermediate/complex-systems)** - Implement sophisticated system interactions and component relationships
  - *Estimated time: 3.5 hours*

- **[Frontend integration](./intermediate/client-integration)** - Connect your Dojo world to React, Unity, and other clients
  - *Estimated time: 4.5 hours*
  - *Skills learned: Client SDK usage, real-time updates, user interface patterns*

### Advanced Tutorials

For experienced developers ready to tackle production-grade implementations and custom tooling.

**Prerequisites**: Solid understanding of Dojo ecosystem and blockchain concepts
**Time commitment**: 5-8 hours per tutorial

- **[Custom indexer development](./advanced/custom-indexer)** - Build custom Torii extensions and data processing pipelines
  - *Estimated time: 6 hours*
