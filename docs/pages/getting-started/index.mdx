# Getting Started with Dojo

Welcome to Dojo! This learning path will guide you from your first "Hello World" to building and deploying your own provable games and autonomous worlds on Starknet.

Dojo is a comprehensive toolchain for building fully on-chain applications using the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture. Whether you're new to blockchain development or an experienced smart contract developer, these tutorials will help you understand Dojo's unique approach to on-chain applications.

## Learning Path Overview

Follow these tutorials in order to build your understanding progressively:

### 1. [Your First Dojo App](your-first-dojo-app)

**Time: 20-30 minutes** | **Prerequisites: None**

Create and deploy your first Dojo project using the spawn-and-move example. You'll learn:

- How to set up a new Dojo project
- Basic ECS concepts (Entities, Components, Systems)
- Running local development tools (Katana, Torii)
- Deploying your first World

### 2. [Understanding the Toolchain](understanding-the-toolchain)

**Time: 15-20 minutes** | **Prerequisites: First Dojo App**

Explore the tools that make Dojo development possible. You'll understand:

- **Katana**: Local Starknet sequencer for development
- **Torii**: Indexing engine for efficient data queries
- **Sozo**: CLI tool for project management and deployment
- How these tools work together in your development workflow

### 3. [Development Workflow](development-workflow)

**Time: 25-35 minutes** | **Prerequisites: Understanding the Toolchain**

Learn the typical development process for Dojo projects. You'll practice:

- Writing and testing new Systems
- Adding and modifying Components
- Using Sozo for common development tasks
- Debugging and iterating on your application

### 4. [Next Steps](next-steps)

**Time: 10 minutes** | **Prerequisites: Development Workflow**

Discover where to go next in your Dojo journey. You'll explore:

- Advanced tutorials and projects
- Client SDK integration options
- Community resources and support
- Deployment to testnet and mainnet

## What You'll Build

Throughout this learning path, you'll work with a simple but complete game where players can:

- Spawn characters in a virtual world
- Move characters around using directional commands
- See real-time updates from other players
- Query game state using GraphQL

This foundation demonstrates all core Dojo concepts while remaining simple enough to understand quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Dojo installed**: Follow the [installation guide](/installation.mdx) if you haven't already
- **Basic command line knowledge**: You'll be running terminal commands
- **Text editor**: Any editor that supports Cairo syntax highlighting (VS Code recommended)

> **Note**: No prior blockchain or Cairo experience is required. We'll explain concepts as we go.
