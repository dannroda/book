# SDK Overview

Dojo SDKs are collections of libraries and tools that help you build applications on Dojo.
We have SDKs for various language and platforms, each designed to handle the under-the-hood details of managing blockchain interactions.

At a high level, SDKs are designed to:

- Translate client-specific game logic into generic ABI-encoded messages
- Store user credentials and sign transactions
- Handle gRPC communication between your game and Dojo's Katana and Torii services

By handling all aspects of the blockchain interactions, the SDKs let you focus on your game logic.

## SDK Development

Dojo maintains a library called [Cainome](https://github.com/cartridge-gg/cainome) ("cairo + genome") used to generate bindings from Cairo code.
Cainome is used to generate the bindings for the SDKs.
