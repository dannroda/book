# Best Practices for Developer Documentation

## Introduction

Good documentation is essential for any software project, especially developer-facing frameworks. No matter how powerful your product is, if its documentation is poor, developers will struggle to use it effectively. High-quality docs improve collaboration, speed up onboarding for new developers, and even drive adoption of your project. The following best practices outline how to create clear, comprehensive developer documentation for a toolchain like **Dojo** (a framework for on-chain games in Cairo), ensuring both newcomers and experienced builders can succeed.

## Make Documentation a Priority

Treat documentation as a first-class part of the development process, not an afterthought. Integrate writing and updating docs into your development workflow and release criteria. Experienced teams know that documentation is a strategic necessity, not just “nice-to-have” – it should be a continuous component of the software lifecycle. This means new features should not ship without appropriate docs, and maintaining docs should be an ongoing effort alongside code changes. By prioritizing documentation early and often, you ensure it stays accurate and helpful as the project evolves.

## Know Your Audience and Define Scope

Developer documentation should be tailored to the needs and skill levels of its audience. Start by identifying who will read the docs (e.g. developers new to on-chain games, versus seasoned Cairo engineers) and what their goals are. For example, newcomers will need clear, concise introductions and step-by-step tutorials, whereas experienced users may skip straight to technical references or advanced guides. A user-centric approach means using language and explanations appropriate to the reader’s background. Avoid unnecessary jargon, or if technical terms are required, define them so that less experienced readers can follow along. By defining the scope and goals of your documentation for each audience segment, you can ensure the content is relevant and neither too simplistic nor overwhelmingly complex.

**Tip:** It often helps to create audience personas or user stories (e.g. “Alice is new to on-chain development and wants to build a simple game” vs. “Bob is an experienced dev looking to integrate Dojo into his pipeline”). This exercise, as recommended by documentation experts, guides what content to include and the level of detail or tutorial guidance to provide.

## Structure Documentation by Use Case

A single doc set should serve multiple purposes. A well-established best practice is to provide several different types of documentation, each with a distinct function, rather than one monolithic guide. In particular, the following documentation components (often known as the Diátaxis or Divio framework) should be kept separate but interconnected:

- **Tutorials (Getting Started):** Learning-oriented guides that **allow newcomers to get started** with your project. Tutorials are step-by-step lessons that walk a developer through building something concrete with Dojo, from scratch. They assume little to no prior knowledge. For example, a tutorial might guide a user through creating their first on-chain game world in Dojo, introducing basic concepts along the way. These should be written in a narrative, beginner-friendly style and focus on achieving a specific end goal (e.g. “Your First Dojo Game”) in a straightforward way.

- **How-To Guides:** Goal-oriented instructions to **solve specific problems or achieve specific tasks**. These guides are recipes or cookbooks for common development tasks. Unlike tutorials (which teach by building a project), how-to guides assume the reader has some basic knowledge and just needs directions to accomplish a particular task. In Dojo’s context, this could include guides like “How to Deploy a Dojo Game to Testnet” or “How to Add a New System Component to an Existing Game”. Each guide should outline prerequisites, then list the steps to complete the task, potentially with brief code snippets or commands. Keep them concise and focused on the task at hand.

- **Reference Documentation:** Technical **reference material describing the machinery** of your software. References are **dry, information-oriented** documents (like an encyclopedia entry) that developers can consult for exact details. This includes API documentation for libraries (functions, classes, modules and their parameters), CLI command reference, configuration file schemas, etc. The reference should be comprehensive and precise, documenting each element of the toolchain’s API or commands. Often, these can be auto-generated from docstrings or code comments, but they should be supplemented with human-friendly descriptions and examples of usage. Experienced developers will rely on this section to look up specific details quickly.

- **Conceptual Explanations:** Discussion or explanation documents aimed at **providing understanding** of broader concepts or design decisions. These are **discursive, knowledge-oriented** pages that don’t necessarily tell the reader how to do something, but rather explain _what_ something is or _why_ it works that way. For instance, you might include an explanation of Dojo’s architecture (e.g. the Entity-Component-System model in on-chain games), a background article on “Fully On-Chain Games: Design Principles”, or an FAQ about how Dojo differs from alternative frameworks. Explanation docs help developers deepen their mental model of the system. They’re especially useful for seasoned developers who want to understand the rationale and context behind the API. Keep these separate from the how-to guides and tutorials, so that a reader looking for conceptual knowledge can find it without wading through step-by-step instructions.

By structuring your documentation into these categories, you fulfill the needs of different users and scenarios. Newcomers can follow tutorials to get started, intermediate users can find recipes to accomplish tasks, and advanced users (or the same users at a different time) can consult references and deep-dives. It also enforces clarity for writers – each document has one job and a distinct style, preventing the docs from becoming a jumble that tries to do everything at once.

## Clear, Concise, and Consistent Writing

When authoring each piece of documentation, focus on clarity and brevity. Use plain language that’s easy to understand and avoid unnecessary jargon. A good rule of thumb is the KISS principle (“Keep It Simple, Stupid”) – write as simply as possible while conveying the necessary information. If you must introduce technical terms or domain-specific concepts (for example, _“Component”_ or _“System”_ in Dojo’s ECS framework), provide a brief definition or link to an explanation so that newcomers aren’t lost.

Aim for a concise style that delivers only the information needed to accomplish the goal. Trying to cover every edge case or including extraneous theory can overwhelm readers. It’s often better to split out such details into separate pages (e.g. an advanced topic or an FAQ) rather than bloating a primary guide. Keep each document focused on a specific topic or task.

**Consistency** in language and formatting is also key to a smooth reading experience. Adopting a style guide for your docs will ensure uniform tone, terminology, and formatting across all pages. A style guide sets rules for things like whether you address the reader as “you”, how you capitalize terms (e.g. consistently referring to the product as “Dojo” and not switching to “the framework” arbitrarily), how code blocks or UI elements are formatted, and so on. This consistency makes documentation feel professional and prevents confusing the reader with mixed styles. It also covers page structure: for example, you might decide that every how-to guide should have sections like _Overview_, _Steps_, and _Next Steps/See Also_. Many organizations publish their documentation style guides (e.g. Microsoft or Google), which can serve as a reference. The bottom line is to maintain a coherent voice and structure so that once a user learns how one part of your docs is organized, other parts feel familiar.

In practice, writing clearly and consistently involves using headings and lists to break up text, as well as highlighting important terms or warnings. Each page should be easily scannable – developers often scroll to find the section they need. Techniques like putting the most important info up front, using descriptive section titles, and highlighting key words in **bold** can improve scannability. Also, prefer active voice and present tense for instructions (e.g. “Run the `dojo build` command” instead of “The user should run…”). Simple, direct language helps prevent misunderstandings.

## Include Code Examples and Visuals

Developers learn best by example. Wherever possible, complement your explanations with code snippets, sample projects, or commands that show how to accomplish a task in context. Concrete examples help bridge the gap between theory and practice, turning documentation into an implementation guide rather than abstract advice. For instance, if you are explaining a Dojo system component, include a short snippet of Cairo code defining a simple system. If a tutorial instructs the user to write some code, show the expected code solution or an excerpt of it so the reader can compare their work.

Consider providing example use-cases or mini-tutorials for key API functions as part of the reference. Many developers will scroll directly to an example before reading the text. As one best practice article notes, _"specific examples and actual scenarios"_, such as code samples, **anchor** your documentation and speed up learning for both novices and experienced devs.

Visual aids are another powerful tool. Diagrams, flowcharts, architecture sketches, or even screenshots can clarify concepts that are hard to grasp from text alone. A well-placed diagram of Dojo’s architecture (e.g. showing how the on-chain world, components, and systems interact) can convey in one image what might require many paragraphs of text. Visuals also make docs more engaging and can accommodate different learning styles. Remember that many people are visual learners, and an illustration of a game lifecycle or a deployment pipeline can be more intuitive than a written description.

When using visuals, ensure they are relevant and properly labeled. Add captions or alt text to explain what a diagram depicts. Keep images simple; highlight only the important parts so as not to overwhelm. Also, consider including diagrams in conceptual explanation docs where appropriate (like an architecture overview), and screenshots in step-by-step tutorials (for example, showing a successful contract deployment in a blockchain explorer). These elements can greatly enhance understanding, as long as they complement rather than replace the textual instructions.

## Ensure Easy Navigation and Discoverability

Organize your documentation site or repository so that developers can quickly find what they need. A clear **structure and format** across pages will help users navigate intuitively. This starts with a logical hierarchy: group related docs into sections (e.g. Setup, Basics, Advanced Guides, Reference, etc.), and provide a navigation menu or table of contents that mirrors this structure. Each page should have a descriptive title and intro so readers know they’re in the right place.

Within pages, use consistent layouts. For example, if every tutorial has an **Introduction**, a **Prerequisites** list, the main content, and a **Summary**, readers come to expect that pattern. Likewise, consistent formatting of headings, lists, callout boxes (for notes/warnings), and code blocks across all docs will create a cohesive feel. Consider using templates for different document types (one for tutorials, one for how-to guides, etc.) to enforce consistency. This standardization makes it easier for users to learn how to use the docs and find information quickly.

**Searchability** is crucial. Many developers will use the search function (or Google) to jump straight to a topic or error message. Use clear headings and keywords that match common search terms. If your docs are on a website, ensure the site is indexed by search engines so that external search leads developers to the right page. It’s also helpful to cross-link related documents within the docs: for example, a tutorial might link to relevant reference pages for more detail, or an explanation article can link to tutorials that put the concept into practice. Cross-references guide readers through the documentation and help them discover content they might otherwise miss.

Finally, remember the principle that **“Every page is page one.”** Many readers will land on a specific doc page without reading earlier material (often via search results or shared links). Therefore, each page should include enough context to stand on its own. For instance, if a how-to guide references a concept like “Component”, and not all readers will have read the intro where that’s defined, it’s wise to briefly reiterate or link to a definition of that term. Don’t assume the user has read things in order – design your documentation so that, no matter where a developer starts, they can orient themselves or find a pointer to prerequisite knowledge.

## Accessibility and Inclusivity

Great developer docs are accessible to a broad audience. This means writing in a way that is inclusive of non-native English speakers and mindful of different needs. Avoid using slang, cultural idioms, or humor that might not translate or could confuse international readers. Keep language straightforward and neutral. If your project uses domain-specific terminology (like “dojo,” “entity,” etc.), explain those in a glossary or at first use, since not everyone will have the same background knowledge.

For accessibility, ensure that your documentation website or format is usable by people with disabilities. Use text sizes and contrast that are readable (e.g. a high-contrast theme for code samples). Provide alternative text for images and diagrams so that someone using a screen reader can still understand the content. If you include videos, consider providing transcripts or summary text. Also, structure your HTML/Markdown with proper headings and lists, which helps both readability and screen-reader navigation.

Another aspect of inclusivity is providing multiple learning pathways. Some developers prefer to read conceptual docs first, others jump into code. By having both explanatory and practical sections, you accommodate different learning styles. Additionally, if possible, offering translations of key documentation into other languages can greatly expand your reach, though this can be a significant undertaking to maintain. At minimum, writing in plain English and explaining acronyms goes a long way to welcoming a global developer audience.

## Continuous Review and Improvement

Documentation is not a one-time effort – it requires ongoing maintenance. As your software evolves, make sure the docs are updated to reflect new features, changes, or deprecations. Outdated documentation can be worse than no documentation, as it leads to confusion and frustration. Establish processes to keep docs in sync with code: for example, when a developer merges a code change, part of the code review checklist can be “Does this require a doc update?” Similarly, consider versioning your documentation alongside software releases (so users can find docs matching the version they use).

Review your documentation regularly. Before publishing, have others test your tutorials and guides by following them step-by-step – they might catch instructions that are unclear or incorrect. Peer review for docs (by engineers or technical writers) can ensure technical accuracy and clarity. If possible, involve some members of your target audience (e.g. invite a new community member to try the “Getting Started” guide) and incorporate their feedback. This kind of user testing will highlight gaps or assumptions you didn’t realize you made.

Once docs are live, treat them as living documents. Encourage users to report issues or suggest improvements (for instance, via GitHub issues or a feedback form on the docs site). Act on feedback promptly – if multiple people ask the same question, that’s a signal to clarify the docs. Many teams adopt a **“Docs as Code”** approach where documentation is stored in the repository and updated via pull requests, just like code. This not only integrates documentation into the development workflow, but also makes it easier for external contributors to propose fixes or enhancements. By lowering the barrier to contribution, your community might help keep the docs comprehensive and correct.

Finally, schedule periodic documentation audits. Every so often (say, each release cycle or quarter), scan through the documentation to weed out stale information, fix broken links, and fill any content gaps. Continuously improving the docs ensures they remain a **“trustworthy and useful resource”** throughout the life of the project, and not something that decays after initial writing. Remember, excellent documentation is an ongoing commitment – but it's one that pays dividends in happier users and a more successful project.

## Conclusion

By following these best practices, the Dojo team can create developer documentation that is both beginner-friendly and rich in technical detail. The key is to provide multiple entry points for different users – from a gentle tutorial onboarding a first-time user, to an extensive reference satisfying an expert’s questions – all presented with clarity and consistency. Investing in great docs will empower your developer community to build and deploy on-chain games more effectively, while reducing support burden and increasing adoption of the Dojo framework. In summary: **make it clear, make it structured, and keep it up-to-date**, and your documentation will become a true asset to your project.
